# Welcome!

This is a simple To Do List app that can display your future tasks.

This app was made as a submission for a job interview. It was made in less than 18 hour. Supposed to be a UI/UX showcase but alas due to time constraint it was impossible for me to polish it further in time.

# Technical Specification
- Built using Xcode 15.3
- Built for iOS 17.4 and up
- Using cocoapods for package manager

## Build step

1. Clone
2. Navigate to and open `todolist.xcworkspace` in Xcode
3. Open `/todolist` directory in your terminal
4. Run `pod install` in your terminal
5. Build and run project in Xcode

# Features
- Add your task along with description and date (and time)
- Mark which task is completed
- Freely edit and delete any task
- Able to highlight certain words and set date automatically (for now only "today")
- Can also move task to the next day by simply drag and drop

## Limitation
- As I said above, time constraint was the most limiting factor
- Essential UI/UX is already on par with apps you can find on app store
- This is still using a static, dummy data. Each app restart will wipe the data. Will need to migrate to a local database if time allows (eg. CoreData)
